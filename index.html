    <p><i>Dyal Singh College owes its origin to the extreme generosity and foresight of Sardar Dyal Singh Majithia, founder of The Tribune and Punjab 
        National Bank , who willed his vast wealth in 1895 for the setting up of an Education Trust for a secular college. Consequently, Dyal Singh 
        College was established at Lahore in 1910, and after the Partition of India, Dyal Singh College was established in Karnal and in Delhi. It 
        started functioning in the capital as a constituent College of the University of Delhi in 1959 and was later taken over by the University of 
        Delhi as a University maintained institution in 1978.The college has been contributing to the solemn task of nation-building since its very 
        inception. Today, Dyal Singh is imparting education to over 6000 students, including foreign students through facilities of Arts, Commerce, 
        Social Sciences, Mathematical Sciences, Computers and Science courses.The college has a state of art infrastructure to meet the pedagogic and 
        research needs of its students and faculty members. These include a well-stocked Library with over one lac books and links to various e-resources. 
        The science departments have well-equipped labs to carry out both teaching and research activities. The computer department has also upgraded 
        computer facilities. The college works for the overall development of the personality along with the academic activities. Our motto is to nurture 
        todays youth to face tomorrows challenges. Making them more employable has been the focus of our college. Our college placement cell takes care 
        of these issues. Sports has been one of the pillars of personality development.</i></p>
        <br><br>
        
    <p>The Department of <b> Computer Science </b> offers 4-year B.Sc.(Hons.) Computer Science programme through constituent colleges of the University 
        of Delhi.With the new advancements in the field of computers and in a time when there is a boom in the IT industry, the University of Delhi has 
        introduced B.Sc (Hons.) Computer Science, a 3-year undergraduate programme, for the tech-savvy youth.The programme provides rigorous foundations 
        of the concepts of Computer Science and Information Technology. In the final year, students also get an opportunity to do project work.
